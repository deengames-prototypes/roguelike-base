# Roguelike Base

A (currently very) basic roguelike shell of a game. Built in Godot. Useful to get your RL done quick.

Currently includes:

- Turn-based movement
- Grid-based movement with smooth animation
- Melee combat
- Procedural animation for melee combat

More to come, inshaAllah (God willing).
